			<p>Back in 2014,Don Don's was just a dream between three friends. We didnt have any idea what we were getting into but we had our ambitions and our drive. So with all of our saving and a small building that needed a lot of work and an old family recipe we founded Don Don's Donuts. The first month of business was really slow ,but after one lady refered us to her friends busy was booming. Business grew more and more and evenutally we had to open a new shop (as seen in the picture above).  </p>

			<p>Now that we moved into our new location we have more space, more workers and more seating we're getting a lot more customers. And we recently just repainted the outside and people are saying thats why they come in cause the outside just looks so welcoming. And our menu has grown larger and larger. We now have a secret menu and we have new donuts holes and more jelly filled donuts.</p>
